CLOSED AND MOVED TO NEW PROJECT
===============================

This project was refactored. Its new repo: https://github.com/marcelbonnet/redmine_tables 


Redmine Custom Tables
==================

This is a fork.

This plugin provides a possibility to create custom tables. The table is built with Redmine custom fields. 

It allows you to create any databases you need for your business and integrate it into your workflow processes using [Redmine Custom Workflows plugin](https://github.com/anteo/redmine_custom_workflows).
